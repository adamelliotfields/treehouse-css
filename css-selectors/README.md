### About this Course

In this short course, we're going to go beyond the basic selector concepts covered in CSS Basics. Besides the common ways to select elements with type, ID and class selectors, we're able to target elements based on their attributes, position in the HTML document, even their relation to other elements. By the end of this course, you'll have gained a better understanding of the power and flexibility behind CSS selectors. You'll have a new set of valuable tools in your CSS toolkit to use on your next project.
