### About this Course

Todayâ€™s websites and applications are larger than ever and a lot hinges on the CSS architecture. CSS that is poorly thought-out can be a strain on development and maintenance in the long run. In this course, we're going to build a UI toolkit using many of the best practices and principles of modular CSS architecture. We'll learn how a modular approach with Sass can boost our workflow and cut down maintenance by reducing the amount of code we write. It can also improve how our code scales because we're able to reuse it on other parts of our project.

### What you'll learn

BEM (Block Element Modifier) pattern  
SMACSS (Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS) pattern  
Writing code that scales, no matter how big the project  
Writing code that others can easily use and maintain  
Writing CSS components that don't rely on context
