### About this Course

Flexbox is a set of CSS properties that give you a flexible way to lay out content. With flexbox you can change the direction, alignment, size and order of elements, regardless of their original size and order in the HTML. You can even stretch and shrink elements and distribute space, all with just a few lines of CSS!
